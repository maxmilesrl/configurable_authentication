Description:
  Creates a migration that adds authentication fields to the given model.

Example:
If you don't have the users table, first create the migration for the model and table:
 $ script/generate model User name:string surname:string email:string

If you already have a users table, you only need to add the authentication related fields:
  $ script/generate configurable_authentication User
  $ rake db:migrate

  This will add the following fields to the user table:
        logon
        password_hash
        salt
